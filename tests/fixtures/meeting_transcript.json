      "excerpt": "**David Lee:** Let's discuss AUTH-123, the Google OAuth implementation.\n\n**Alice Chen:** I've been looking at this. The main decision is whether to use authorization code flow or implicit flow.\n\n**Bob Smith:** Definitely authorization code with PKCE. Implicit flow is deprecated for web apps now.\n\n**Carol Davis:** Agreed. Also, we need to think about token storage. I suggest using our vault service.\n\n**David Lee:** Good point. Alice, can you make sure to use the vault client from the infra package?\n\n**Alice Chen:** Yes, I'll use the existing VaultClient. One question - should we support refresh token rotation?\n\n**Bob Smith:** Yes, that's a security best practice. Rotate refresh tokens on each use.\n\n**David Lee:** Let's make that a requirement for AUTH-123.",

      "excerpt": "**Emily Wang:** I'm reviewing AUTH-123 for security. A few concerns.\n\n**Alice Chen:** Sure, go ahead.\n\n**Emily Wang:** First, make sure the state parameter is cryptographically random and verified on callback.\n\n**Frank Miller:** Also check the redirect URI validation. It should be an exact match, not a prefix.\n\n**Alice Chen:** Got it. I'll add both of those checks.\n\n**Emily Wang:** Last thing - the session cookie should be httpOnly and secure flags set.\n\n**Alice Chen:** Already planned. I'm following our AuthMiddleware patterns.\n\n**Emily Wang:** Great. Looks good otherwise. Approve once those changes are in.",
